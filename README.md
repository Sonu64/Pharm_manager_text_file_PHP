# Pharm_manager_text_file_PHP
This repo is created to explain that text files really has more power than you think, though not better than Databases.This is a Pharmacy
management system developed using PHP, HTML and CSS, and yeah it includes permamanent data storage, like databases. But SQL isn't used as 
my target was to be fluent with PHP File handling, and I wanted to show that Text Files have a bit more power than many persons think. 
There are 4 options - Add a Medicine, where a .txt file with the name of the medicine is created.
                    - Add Stock to an existing medicine, where stock is added to an existing medicine, for example, if 20 stock be added
                      to a medicine with 100 stock available, it would change to 120.
                    - Buy a medicine, where a bill is shown on the right, when the buying form is filled up and submitted. Automatic 
                    update occurs in the text file acting as the storage.
                    - Delete a medicine, where the .txt file in the name of the medicine is deleted.

If any error occurs, for example if the user is tryes to add stock to medicine which is not in main stock, i.e., the file is not created by 
that name, Error of "Medicine not found in main stock !" is shown in the page.

SPECIAL NOTES :-

PROPER SECURITY SYSTEM.

THIS IS REALLY A FUNNY PROJECT, NOT AT ALL FOR A REAL WORLD PHARMACY. :-D :-D
